Want to contribute? Check out our [Code of Conduct](./docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) docs. This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!

There are many topics yet to be covered by this set of koans. I have added a handful of needed topics as [issues](https://github.com/NotMyself/rocksmith-plus-tools/issues) and tagged them as [Up for Grabs](https://github.com/NotMyself/rocksmith-plus-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Up+for+Grabs%22). There are even some specifically tagged as [Beginner Friendly](https://github.com/NotMyself/rocksmith-plus-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Beginner+Friendly%22).

If you have never contributed to an open source project, let those be your first. I promise to work with you to get your contribution into the repository and be friendly and encouraging about it. It is what Jim would have done.

If you think a topic is missing, propose it's inclusion by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/NotMyself/rocksmith-plus-tools/issues/new) yourself. Or better yet submit the issue and an accompanying pull request with how you think the topic should be introduced. Think about beginners in your effort; be clear and informative, be concise and most of all be playful with your examples.
